#	This is a boot code for a multi-processor architecture  supporting
#	multi-tasking. There is up to 4 tasks per processor, and
#	the number of processors cannot be larger than NB_PROCS.
#	Task(p,k) is identified by two indexes :
#	- p (between 0 and ND_PROCS-1) is the processor index
#	- k (between 0 and 3) is the task local index
#
#	The placement of tasks on the processors is statically defined
#	in the local tasks_entry_point[] array, that is indexed by m = 4*p + k.
#	Each entry contains a function pointer.
#
#	The actual number of tasks per processor can be smaller than 4.
#	It is defined in the _task_number_array[], indexed by the pid.
#	Each entry is an usigned char.
#
#	The ICU mask value for each processor is defined in the local
#	icu_masks_array[] indexed by the pid, with the following layout:
#	- IRQ_IN [0]		IOC
#	- IRQ_IN [8:11]		DMA_0 to DMA_3
#	- IRQ_IN [12:15]	TIMER_O to TIMER_3
#	- IRQ_IN [16:31]	TTY_0 to TTY_15
#
#	The _task_context_array[] layout is statically defined:
#	A single task context requires 256 bytes (64 words).
#	As there is at most 4 tasks per processor, and 4 processors,
#	the total memory space to store the contexts is 16*256 = 4K bytes.
#
#	This boot code :
#	- statically allocate tasks to processors, initialising
#	  the _tasks_entry_point[] and _task_number_array[].
#	- initializes the _task_context_array[] for tasks T(n,k) with k> 0
#	  (defines the future values for registers SR, EPC, SP, RA)
#	- It initializes the interrupt vector (TTYs, TIMERs, DMAs, IOC)
#	  and initializes the icu_mask_array[] for all processors.
#	- It defines the TICK value, and lauch the timer corresponding
#	  to the processor index.
#	- It initializes the EPC, SP, SR registers for tasks T(n,0), 
#	  and jumps to the task entry point in user mode.
